# Financial-Fraud-Detector-Credit-Cards-
This project uses Machine learning techniques to determine fraudulent transaction for a credit card company 


The project was inspired by a Kaggle.com competition where I got the data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The models were able to learn and get a +90% accuracy with minimal overhead. 
Enjoy.
